I fell asleep with C++ and woke up with Rust. <br/>
But at the same time, I still have to go to C# <br/>
So sometimes I go to JS/TS to relax <br/>
</br>
I love programming because it allows you to create huge amazing systems, ⚙️ <br/>
because together with mathematics 📏 it literally creates magic. 🌈 <br/>
What if we add physics 🧲 and biology? 🔬. The limit is only in your imagination. 🌌 <br/>
<br/>
So, I just want to continue to have the opportunity to create, and develop in this area, <br/>
so that I can create more and more amazing things ✏️
